API Key Authentication
VTpass uses API Keys for authentication, to generate API keys kindly follow the steps below.

Steps on how to generate your api keys:
To generate your api key for:
The live environment, go to your VTpass profile here.
The Sandbox environment, go to to your Sandbox profile here.
Click on the API Keys tab on your profile page.
Ensure that API AUTHENTICATION TYPE is set to all or API keys.
Copy your static API Key and click on the text that says click to generate your public and secret key which will be shown to you just once. So you’ll need to copy it out before leaving that page. If paraventure you didn’t copy the secret or public key, you’ll need to generate a new set of keys.
 

How to use your api keys:
For GET request you’ll need to pass the api-key and public-key through the request header.
api-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
public-key: PK_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
For POST request you’ll need to pass the api-key and secret-key through the request header.
api-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
secret-key: SK_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx



How to generate Request ID
This section contains the recommended format of generating request ID

Request ID Format
The Request ID should be a string in the unix format YYYYMMDDHHII consisting of today’s date + current hour and minute (e.g: 202201301610) and can be concatenated with any other alphanumeric string as desired (e.g: 202201301610ad8ef08acd8fc0f or 2022013016104738492849).

Note:

MUST BE 12 CHARACTERS OR MORE
FIRST 12 CHARACTERS MUST BE NUMERIC
FIRST 12 CHARACTERS MUST COMPRISE OF TODAY’S DATE
Date and Time should be in Africa/Lagos Timezone or GMT +1
 

Example
    "request_id" => "202202071830YUs83meikd"
